## Introduction

My name is Sanna Porkka. I study linguistics in the University of Helsinki, and my focus is on language technology. This is my second year of studying, so there is still a lot more studying to do, but I'm excited to learn more about coding and languages! My hobbies include painting, running and shooting with guns and bows. I'm part of a student nation called Hämäläis-osakunta or Tavastia Nation in English. I'm very active there and I am an officer there, right now helping with events and in the future I hope to do many other jobs too.
